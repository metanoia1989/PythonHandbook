Contact
=======

The AppImage project documentation is brought to you by `the AppImage team <https://github.com/AppImage>`_. The source code is available `on GitHub <https://github.com/AppImage/docs.appimage.org>`_.

This page outlines how you can contact the team behind AppImage, e.g., to get additional support or have questions answered.


IRC
---

If you have further questions, please feel free to contact the AppImage team. The easiest and fastest way is to join our `IRC channel #appimage <irc://chat.freenode.net/appimage>`_ on `Freenode <https://freenode.net>`_ (`webchat <https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=appimage>`_).

.. note::

   Please beware that it might take a few minutes/hours until someone will check the chat and might be able to help you, so don't give up too quickly, and leave e.g., the tab open in the background if you can. You can also try at other times again. Please read `this article <https://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc/>`_ before joining the IRC chat if you are new to IRC.


Forum
-----

A slower but more sustainable way is to use the `Discourse forum <https://discourse.appimage.org>`_. You can log in using your existing Google or GitHub account, or alternatively register a local account with your email address.
