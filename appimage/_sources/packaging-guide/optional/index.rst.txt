Optional Resources and Features
===============================

If you have followed our packaging guide to this point: congratulations! You should have a working AppImage by now.

However, the produced AppImage can be improved further. We provide some additional features such as :ref:`binary delta updating <ref-updates>` and a standardized and verifiable :ref:`signature mechanism <ref-signatures>`.

Also, you can add optional resources such as :ref:`AppStream metadata <ref-appstream>` to allow tools which work with AppImages such as :ref:`AppImageHub <ref-appimagehub>` to display additional information about your AppImage.

The following section explains these optional features and resources, and shows how these can be enabled resp. added.
